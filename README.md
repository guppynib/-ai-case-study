# Ocrolus: Automation Platform

## Overview and Origin
Ocrolus is a automation platform with services in the financial technology field. They focus on automated data extraction, document verification, cash flow analysis, fraud detection, loan origination, and compliance & reporting (Source 1). Ocrolus was founded in 2014 by Sam Bobley and Vik Narayan. The company was founded after the realization of the innefficiences and innaccuracies involved with manual data entry. Ocrolus has received millions of dollars in investing with their most recent round of funding receiving 80 millions dollars in 2021 (Sources 2 & 4).

## Business Activities
Ocrolus aims to solve the problem of inefficient and error-prone manual data entry in financial services. Their platform automates the analysis and extraction of data from complex financial documents, improving accuracy and efficiency. Ocrolus serves financial institutions, lenders, and FinTech companies that deal with large volumes of financial documents. This field of financial services is increasing with a projected compound annual growth rate of 9.7% for 2024-2032 (Source 5). Ocrolus combines machine learning with human verification to ensure high accuracy in document processing. Their ability to handle a wide variety of document types and their focus on the financial sector gives them a competitive edge.
With machine learning and computer vision technologies, they are able to analyze and extract data from financial documents. In order to verify the extracted data they employ a combination of AI and human-in-the-loop (human verification) systems.

## Landscape
Ocrolus is in the financial technology field. The origins of this company lie in automation of manual processes. With the rise of AI and machine learning, there is an increasing number of manual processes that can be automated. As described by Indico (another document automation company), the future advancements in this field include; enhanced AI and ML capabilities, real-time data processing, predictive analytics, integration with other technologies, customization and flexibility, and enhanced security measures (Source 6). This is a highly competitive field with several companies that exist within the document automation and financial technology such as Cymonix, PerfOps, 114 AI Innovation, and IQM (Source 6).

## Results
Ocrolus  improves efficiency and accuracy of financial data processes for their clients. This reduces the time and cost associated with financial data entrys and their processes involved.
The core metrics of this company includes; processing speed, accuracy rate, customer satisfaction, and cost savings (Source 1). Ocrolus is considered one of the leaders in the document automation field within the financial technology industry. Their combination of AI and human verification steps seperate them from their competitors.

## Recommendations
In terms of recommendations for Ocrolus, I would suggest for them to expand their services to other document automation platforms outside of the financial technology industry.
I believe if they can expand their document automation services to a wider variety of fields they could increase there total market share in terms of the document automation services industry.
This expansion would utilize their existing capabilities of document automation and apply them to other potential use cases for document automation in other fields. 
Since this technology exists within Ocrolus's capabilities, it would simply look at the application methods and specific use cases for it.
